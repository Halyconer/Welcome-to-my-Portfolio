          <p>
            Bridging worlds from the tropics to New York, I'm an Economics student at NYU with a fascination for understanding what makes our global systems tick. My journey combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, whether I'm diving into finance or coding new solutions in tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed in data or market trends, you can find me in the garage with NYU Motorsports, or on the pier playing football. There's something magical about transforming technical knowledge into tangible results—whether it's optimizing race performance through telemetry or building financial models that reveal hidden patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in spaces where precision meets innovation. My self-taught coding adventures in Python have evolved from curiosity to creating practical applications, from race car dashboards to smart home solutions. This blend of quantitative analysis and technical creativity drives everything I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sports have taught me the value of strategy, teamwork, and performance under pressure—principles I apply to every challenge I tackle. I'm constantly seeking connections between seemingly disparate fields, finding that the best solutions often emerge at these intersections.
